## Installation
### This app has been deployed to Heroku so it can be opened via its link. If you would like to run it locally then npm install and then nodemon server.js or npm start.

## Usage
### When a person is trying to track their budget they need to be able to do it anytime and anywhere. Having a constant app by their side makes this easier. However, we have to note that some users may not have internet connection all the time. This app was created to allow the user to download it offline and still have the app work. While offline the app will work normally and once connected with the internet the local changes will be pushed to the live app.
